# Project Title: Does presence of Multiple Drug Intolerance Syndrome predict higher rates of health care utilization and chronic pain?

#5.	Study Question, Objectives, and Hypothesis:

Many perioperative pain researchers are interested in pre-operative patient factors that predict post-operative pain and opioid utilization.  We want to know if Multiple Drug Intolerance Syndrome (MDIS) is such a factor. We also seek to understand is MDIS is associated with higher rates of health care utilization defined by: diagnosis including chronic pain diagnosis, office visits, imaging, procedures or surgeries. If MDIS was found to be associated with higher perioperative opioid usage then this population may benefit from higher usages of opioid-sparing techniques in the OR and PACU for pain control.
